This is a project where we take an audio-input signal, filter a rectangular wave from it and use that to create harmonics below or above the input signal.

Features:
- can be used directly with electric guitar output or a synthesizer output.
- 4 harmonic waves can be generated
- selectable waveform: SIN, TRI, RMP, SAW and Square
- Clean and harmonic blend mixer
